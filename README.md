##  How to Navigate

### For LeetCode:
```
LeetCode/[Difficulty]/[Problem-Number]-[Problem-Name]/
```
**Example**: `LeetCode/Easy/001-two-sum/`

### For CodeForces:
```
CodeForces/[Division]/Round-[Number]/Problem-[Letter]/
```
**Example**: `CodeForces/Division-2/Round-850/Problem-A/`

---

### Study Approach

1. **Understand** the problem thoroughly
2. **Plan** the approach before coding
3. **Implement** a brute force solution first
4. **Optimize** for better time/space complexity
5. **Test** with multiple test cases
6. **Document** the solution with explanations

---

##  Goals

- [ ] Solve 100+ LeetCode problems
- [ ] Reach Expert on CodeForces
- [ ] Master all common patterns (Two Pointers, Sliding Window, DP, etc.)
- [ ] Participate in weekly contests regularly
- [ ] Help others learn through detailed explanations
